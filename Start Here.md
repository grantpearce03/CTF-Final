The only things you really need to focus on is OSINT and knowing how to navigate a webpage. To make it more challenging for yourself, do not change any of the elements on the webpage. To be Completely Frank, I believe you can do this...good luck.

If you want a less ambiguous search, go into the "clearing things up" file, where you will know exactly what skills you will need and where you will need to go.
