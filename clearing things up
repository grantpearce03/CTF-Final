The specific skills you will need: OSINT and ctrl/cmmd + f look up
The websites you should be logged into: Facebook and LinkedIn

When you go to a certain website, you will need to discover key words from the OSINT hunt to know what you need to do the ctrl/cmmd + f look ups.
The first place you should look is Facebook, then the website, then linkedin, then back to the website.
The ctf is broken up into three parts that you will need to find.
If you are struggling finding the profiles in the OSINT lookup, you can use my account on both Facebook and LinkedIn(Grant Pearce) to find the right accounts.

Good Luck!
