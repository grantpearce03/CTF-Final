Step 1:

Look at the ReadMe file and notice that the words Completely Frank are capitalized, indicating that it is a name, not just two words. When you do an OSINT search on Facebook,
you will find a profile named Completely Frank. it gives you the first part of the CTF and a clue under the About you section.

Step 2:

Go to the website linked within the profile, and it will take you to a page with the entire book Faherenheit 451 but the words whited out. This is to create more of a challenge.
The Facebook profile says there is one relative, a Nephew named Arthur. Doing a word search on the website for Arthur gives you the second part of the CTF.
